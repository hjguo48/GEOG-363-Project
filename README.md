# GEOG-363-Project

Crime in New York City has always been a concern, especially the shooting incidents, which takes many lives every year. Indeed, with the introduction of many policies that benefit the people and the development of the economy, the overall number of shooting incidents in New York has continued to decline since the beginning of this century. But there is still an overall high number of crimes. 

Therefore, I want to make this project to analyze the variation trend of shooting incidents in New York City every year and every hour since 2006, as well as the spatial analysis of the relationship between deterrence range of Brooklyn police stations and the distribution of shooting incidents.

Data:
